									<p>About a month prior to this Bufo experience, I had an experience with DMT that
										really shook things
										up. </p>

									<p>I had my partner, at the time, do a tarot reading for me. Because up to that
										point I'd been nervous about attempting DMT. I'd watched so many of the videos
										that are now on this platform and I thought I had some idea what I could expect,
										but fear was still a factor. The card reading was exactly what I needed to take
										the plunge. I sat on the edge of the bed and pulled in the three required
										inhalations of the DMT. By the secoond pull I was positive I didn't need a third
										pull, but I did it anyway because I knew it was very likely that I'd only have
										this experience once and I knew that I wanted to break through. On the second
										pull, the room I was in barely resembled what you see in the image below.
										Everything was still there, but it felt and looked like I was in a temple. The
										only words that come close to describing where I was after that third pull are
										"holy", "reverant", "Ancient Egypt", "heavenly". I know that Egypt is a weird
										word to
										throw in there, especially considering I've never been, but that descriptor
										still holds true, as I write these words nearly a year later.
									</p>


									<p>I won't go into the entire experience of breaking through. But I journaled about
										it right
										after the experience in great detail. If you would like to reach out to me about
										those pages, I will gladly send them to you. </p>

									<p>I posted the image below of the plant because as I was coming out of the
										experience, that plant in the picture was alive! It was moving and flowing. I
										really wished that I would have thought to touch it. But I was so in awe of
										everything that I had just experienced and was still experiencing. It was so
										incredibly amazing...</p>


									<p>I was shown the Truth about myself and following that experience one of the
										decisions that I made was
										to leave my partner of seven years. Following that, I rented an airbnb in
										Atlanta for a month, and tried to figure things out. I felt like I was being
										guided but I had
										no idea where I was going or what I was supposed to do. I spent that time alone
										meditating, walking and processing that DMT experience. It was so
										profound! I had
										no idea experiences like that were possible on this planet.</p>

									<p>A couple of weeks went by and one day I watched a video of a woman having a very
										beautiful bufo experience. I knew what bufo was because it had come up in my
										research of DMT. I
										knew that it was meant for me to experience one day but until that moment I had
										not considered that
										it could happen so soon. In the comments of the video that I watched, someone
										asked about where
										they could have an experience like this and the woman responded with the website
										information. I reached out to the organization and found out that the next
										retreat would be in
										less than 10 days and only 2 hours away from me. I immediately booked the
										retreat.
									</p>

									<p>I want to preface the video by saying that the four people who went before me had
										very
										calm and quiet experiences —although profound, and I expected mine to be the
										same. As a matter of
										fact, I was feeling very out of my element and annoyed that this retreat was a
										camping retreat and taking place outside in the woods. There were ticks all over
										everybody,
										someone had recently spotted poison ivy where we were all sitting, I had been
										too cold to get enough sleep the night before because I was sleeping in a tent
										—without a blanket, and I was around a whole bunch of hippie white peoople who
										all seemed to pretty much know each other. Basically, I just wanted to hurry up
										and have my
										experience with Bufo and figure out how to get out of there as quickly as
										possible.
									</p>



									<p>What the video doesn't show is what happened inside of me... something that I
										can't even really put into words. Within five seconds of breathing in the
										medicine and holding it, It was like everything and everyone around me
										disappeared. There was only me in the entire universe. I was the universe. This
										realization at first startled me and then I felt fear. Then the illusion of
										control vanished and I let go. I felt waves of intense sound and energy washing
										over me. It was happening so fast that it was like a strobe pulsing. I can't
										describe what I saw but it was an opportunity to release my grasp on all the
										crap that I'd been holding onto. All the trauma, shame, self-doubt, caring what
										other people thought of me, beliefs that didn't serve me, holding myself
										back.... all of that dead weight that I'd been carrying, along with the
										root of why I'd been carrying it.... was being released.</p>
									<p> I felt as if all of my
										Chakras were opened and that negative energy that kept me unbalanced and kept me
										from being me just shot
										out of me. I don't raise my voice and definitely don't raise it around a
										bunch of strangers. In those moments I was aware of their presence but I didn't
										care, I just let
										it all out of me. I freed myself! After that experience I felt so much lighter,
										freer and so much more myself than I've ever felt. Before I lived my life as if
										I was always being observed, always trying to do what I thought was the right
										thing, but for who? Not me. The real me had become buried under everyone else's
										expectation and I didn't know how to escape that. Within minutes I burst free
										and it felt like breathing. It felt like living! I looked around at everyone and
										I could feel their genuine happiness for my freedom. It was an incredible
										experience. It was the reset that I needed.</p>
									<p>This video shows the first ceremony with bufo, but I actually ended up
										doing it a second time, two days later at the same retreat.</p>
