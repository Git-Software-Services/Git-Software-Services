									<p>About a month prior to this Bufo experience, I had an experience with DMT that
										really shook things
										up. </p>

									<p>I had my my wife, at the time, do a tarot reading for me. Because up to that
										point I'd been nervous about attempting DMT. I'd watched so many of the videos
										that are now on this platform and I thought I had some idea what I could expect,
										but fear was still a factor. The card reading was exactly what I needed to take
										the plunge. I sat on the edge of the bed and pulled in the three required
										inhalations of the DMT. By the secoond pull I was positive I didn't need a third
										pull, but I did it anyway because I knew it was very likely that I'd only have
										this experience once and I knew that I wanted to break through. On the second
										pull, the room I was in barely resembled what you see in the image below.
										Everything was still there, but it felt and looked like I was in a temple. The
										only words that come close to describing where I was after that third pull are
										"holy", "reverant", "Ancient Egypt", "heavenly". I know that Egypt is a weird
										word to
										throw in there, especially considering I've never been, but that descriptor
										still holds true, as I write these words nearly a year later.
									</p>


									<p>I won't go into the entire experience of breaking through. I do dive a bit
										deeper
										into my DMT experience in the Bufo Ceremony Description video below.</p>


									<p>I posted the image below of the plant because as I was coming out of the
										experience, that plant in the picture was alive! It was moving and flowing. I
										really wished that I would have thought to touch it. But I was so in awe of
										everything that I had just experienced and was still experiencing. It was so
										incredibly amazing...</p>


									<p>I was shown the Truth about myself and following that experience one of the
										decisions that I made was
										to leave my partner of seven years. Following that, I rented an airbnb in
										Atlanta for a month, and tried to figure things out. I felt like I was being
										guided but I had
										no idea where I was going or what I was supposed to do. I spent that time alone
										meditating, walking and processing that DMT experience. It was so
										profound! I had
										no idea experiences like that were possible on this planet.</p>

									<p>A couple of weeks went by and one day I watched a video of a woman having a very
										beautiful bufo experience. I knew what bufo was because it had come up in my
										research of DMT. I
										knew that it was meant for me to experience one day but until that moment I had
										not considered that
										it could happen so soon. In the comments of the video that I watched, someone
										asked about where
										they could have an experience like this and the woman responded with the website
										information. I reached out to the organization and found out that the next
										retreat would be in
										less than 10 days and only 2 hours away from me. I immediately booked the
										retreat.
									</p>

									<p>I want to preface the video by saying that the four people who went before me had
										very
										calm and quiet experiences —although profound, and I expected mine to be the
										same. As a matter of
										fact, I was feeling very out of my element and annoyed that this retreat was a
										camping retreat and taking place outside in the woods. There were ticks all over
										everybody,
										someone had recently spotted poison ivy where we were all sitting, I had been
										too cold to get enough sleep the night before because I was sleeping in a tent
										—without a blanket, and I was around a whole bunch of hippie white peoople who
										all seemed to pretty much know each other. Basically, I just wanted to hurry up
										and have my
										experience with Bufo and figure out how to get out of there as quickly as
										possible.
									</p>



									<p>What the video doesn't show is what happened inside of me... something that I
										can't even really put into words. Within five seconds of breathing in the
										medicine and holding it, It was like everything and everyone around me
										disappeared. There was only me in the entire universe. I was the universe. This
										realization at first startled me and then I felt fear. Then the illusion of
										control vanished and I let go. I felt waves of intense sound and energy washing
										over me. It was happening so fast that it was like a strobe pulsing. I can't
										describe what I saw but it was an opportunity to release my grasp on all the
										crap that I'd been holding onto. All the trauma, shame, self-doubt, caring what
										other people thought of me, beliefs that didn't serve me, holding myself
										back.... all of that dead weight that I'd been carrying, along with the
										root of why I'd been carrying it.... was being released.</p>
									<p> I felt as if all of my
										Chakras were opened and that negative energy that kept me unbalanced and kept me
										from being me just shot
										out of me. I don't raise my voice and definitely don't raise it around a
										bunch of strangers. In those moments I was aware of their presence but I didn't
										care, I just let
										it all out of me. I freed myself! After that experience I felt so much lighter,
										freer and so much more myself than I've ever felt. Before I lived my life as if
										I was always being observed, always trying to do what I thought was the right
										thing, but for who? Not me. The real me had become buried under everyone else's
										expectation and I didn't know how to escape that. Within minutes I burst free
										and it felt like breathing. It felt like living! I looked around at everyone and
										I could feel their genuine happiness for my freedom. It was an incredible
										experience. It was the reset that I needed.</p>
									<p>This video shows the first ceremony with bufo, but I actually ended up
										doing it a second time, two days later at the same retreat.</p>
									<p>So much has happened in my life since that first bufo experience. I understood
										after that the amount of self-work and healing that was needed. Bufo released so
										much that was inside of me that needed to come out, but I also became aware of
										all the rest of it.</p>
									<p>
										I do not believe that these healing modalities are the shortcut to enlightenment
										but I do think that they offer tremendous insight into who we are and our
										purpose. They allow us to get out of our own way so that we can live lives that
										are more fulfilling because we face our fears and the Truth and understand that
										they are the same. By choosing to have these experiences we begin to know
										experientially as opposed to conceptually, that we are the creators of our own
										experiences and that lived knowingness is freedom.</p>
									<p>
										I drop a lot of F-bombs in this video. I think that word came in really handy in
										enabling me to express to the best of my ability what I'd just experienced.
										It's taken me a very long time to make this video public. It's an extremely
										vulnerable experience but one that I know that other people need to see because
										it was videos of other people having and sharing their experiences that led to
										me having my own experience. It's also the reason this platform exists.</p>

									<p>
										This is my fourth bufo experience. In this experience I released so much! It was
										very different from my first experience with Bufo.</p>
									<p>No matter how many times I sit with this medicine or any other entheogen, I have
										to face the fear that comes up for me right before I consume it. But as soon as
										I'm in the experience I am free. In my second, third, and fourth Bufo experience
										I said the words "I remember!" Although I don't have any recollection of this, I
										know that entering into the experience for me is like going back to a place that
										I've long forgotten.</p>
									<p>I say God a lot. This has to do with my religious upbringing and the programming
										associated with that. There is a disassociation between sex and God that I often
										purge while in these experiences because of childhood trauma and enforced
										religious teachings around these topics. Being taught that they are separate has
										created a lot of fear and shame around sex and alienation of what God truly is
										to me.</p>
									<p>I apologize a lot in this experience. I apologize to my mother. I don't call her
										mommy, but in my experience I do. As if the child version of me is speaking. I
										didn't know why I said this when I came out of the experience. Not until I
										started integration work. I discovered a Truth that I had kept to myself for a
										very long time. As a child I made a decision that impacted our relationship very
										early in my life. I decided that I didn't want to be like my mother. Emotionally
										I kept my distance from her, always reminding myself that to get to close by
										fostering the mother/daughter relationship that she wanted, meant that I would
										end up just like her. I wanted to be strong, like my dad and three older
										brothers. I didn't want to wash dishes and fold clothes. I didn't want to always
										have to succumb to the provider of the household. I didn't want to "know my
										place". I resented her for not being an example to me of what I thought a strong
										black woman should be. When I realized this truth, I could not stop crying
										because what I also realized was that my mom was a great mother to me. She was
										the best mother she could be. As I thought back over my childhood I could
										clearly see how much she loved me and did her very best to provide for me and my
										brothers. About a week after the experience I called her and shared all of this
										with her.</p>
									<p>Integration is just as much a part of the healing as the actual bufo
										experience.</p>
									<p>The other thing that came up for me in this bufo experience that I would like to
										share is what was once such a source of shame and humiliation. I have facial
										hair, the result of PCOS, something that many women deal with. For decades I've
										hid this about myself and gone to such great lengths to keep this a secret. It's
										something that I didn't share with my ex-wife or my current partner despite our
										closeness and intimacy. It was my shameful secret and it impacted me daily. I
										wouldn't let anyone touch my face, even my partner, for fear that she would then
										know. I wore make-up to hide any trace of facial hair, something that I would
										not do otherwise. I would become anxious if someone stood too close to me. I
										hated it so much. It caused me so much shame, and it was on my face!</p>
									<p>In this experience I freed myself of that shame. In hindsight, it absolutely had
										to be done this way and it had to be done in front of my partner or perhaps I
										would have walked away from the experience and never told anyone about it.
										Instead it led to deep and meaningful conversations around conditioning and my
										beliefs when it comes to standards of beauty. In that initial conversation when
										I shared this with my partner, I could not stop crying. The person that I worked
										through my integration with, shared with me that when you speak your truth for
										the first time, you will cry. You cry because you are releasing and hearing that
										truth is freeing and beautiful. Letting go of that shame was not easy, but it
										was healing and I am free. After sharing all of this with my partner, we've
										since then continued to have conversations around it. Conversations that would
										have been impossible for me to have before this experience.</p>
									<p>Next I grabbed my partner and apologize some more. At some point I couldn't
										breath, because I could hear how her asthma was effecting her breathing, somehow
										her difficulty breathing became me having trouble breathing. My breath became
										even more shallow until it stopped and I knew that I died. But in that instance
										I was born. There was no fear. Just one experience melded seamlessly into the
										next. Death and then Birth. Then I was a never-ending being in a new form. I
										could see everyone around me as if for the first time. The love and acceptance I
										felt from them made me cry. The simplicity of this life and the beauty of it all
										made me sob.</p>
									<p>So much about my experiences are personal but this is my Truth and
										to be able to share it with the world is what freedom is to me.
