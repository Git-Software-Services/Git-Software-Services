											Experience</a></h2>

									</div>

									<p>About a month prior to this I had an experience with DMT that really shook things
										up. I was shown the Truth about myself and following that experience I made the
										decision to leave my partner of seven years. I was staying in an airbnb in
										Atlanta, trying to figure things out. I felt like I was being guided but I had
										no idea where I was going or what I was going to do. I took that time alone to
										meditate, think, walk and process that DMT experience. It was so profound! I had
										no idea experiences like that were possible on this planet.
										A couple of weeks went by and one day I watched a video of a woman having a very
										beautiful bufo experience. I knew what bufo was because I'd researched it. I
										knew that one day I would do it but until that moment I had not considered that
										it would happen so soon. In the comments of the video someone asked about where
										they could have an experience like this and the woman responded with the website
										information. I reached out to them and found out that the next retreat would be
										less than 10 days away and only 2 hours away from me. I booked the retreat and
										went. This video shows the first ceremony with bufo, but I actually ended up
										doing it a second time, two days later at the same retreat.
									<p>What the video doesn't show is what happened inside of me... something that I
										can't even really put into words. Within five seconds of breathing in the
										medicine and holding it, It was like everything and everyone around me
										disappeared. There was only me in the entire universe. I was the universe. This
										realization at first startled me and then I felt fear. Then the illusion of
										control vanished and I let go. I felt waves of intense sound and energy washing
										over me. It was happening so fast that it was like a strobe pulsing. I can't
										describe what I saw but it was an opportunity to release my grasp on all the
										crap that I'd been holding onto. All the trauma, shame, self-doubt, caring what
										other people thought of me, beliefs that didn't serve me, holding myself
										back.... like all of that dead weight that I'd been carrying, along with the
										root of why I'd been carrying it.... was being released.</p>
									<p> It was like all of my
										Chakras were opened and that negative energy that kept me unbalanced just shot
										out of me. I'm not the person to raise my voice and definitely not around a
										bunch of strangers. I was aware of them around me but I didn't care, I just let
										it all out of me. I freed myself! After that experience I felt so much lighter,
										freer and so much more myself than I've ever felt. Before I lived my life as if
										I was always being observed, always trying to do what I thought was the right
										thing, but for who? Not me. The real me had become buried under everyone else
										expectation and I didn't know how to escape that. Within minutes I burst free
										and it felt like breathing. It felt like living! I looked around at everyone and
										I could feel their genuine happiness for my freedom. It was an incredible
										experience. It was the reset that I needed.</p>
